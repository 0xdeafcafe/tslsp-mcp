claude finds references by grepping. claude renames things by find-and-replacing. this is fine until your symbol is called `User` or `get` or `value`, at which point it confidently rewrites half your codebase and tells you it's done. thanks, gas-lightyear.

how do real editors function? they ask the typescript language server, which actually understands what's a reference vs what's just a string. `tslsp-mcp` gives claude that same superpower over an MCP server or a regular CLI. rename is type-aware. references are real references. moving a file rewrites every import that pointed at it. `outline` is the LSP's structural view, not "read 200 lines and hope."

it spawns [tsgo](https://github.com/microsoft/typescript-go), microsoft's native go port of tsserver, per `tsconfig.json` it sees, keeps it warm, and routes tool calls to the right one. one process per project, lazy-spawned, not one per request.

designed in my head, built by claudus, tested on your codebase, cheers.

## you need

- node 22+
- a typescript project (anything with a `tsconfig.json`)
- [claude code](https://claude.com/claude-code), or any other MCP / skill-aware host

## install

two flavours. pick whichever your agent likes — they expose the same tools.

### CLI + skill

```bash
npm install -g @0xdeafcafe/tslsp-mcp
tslsp install --skills              # ~/.claude/skills/tslsp/SKILL.md
tslsp install --skills --project    # ./.claude/skills/tslsp (commit it)
```

the skill tells claude when to reach for `tslsp` instead of `Grep`/`Edit`/`mv`. `tslsp --help` lists every command; the agent can drive it raw from `--help` if you skip the skill.

### MCP

```bash
claude mcp add -s user tslsp -- npx -y @0xdeafcafe/tslsp-mcp
```

`-s user` makes it available in every project. drop it (and run from a project dir) to scope to one repo.

prefer to run from source? clone, build, point claude at the built file:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/0xdeafcafe/tslsp-mcp.git
cd tslsp-mcp && pnpm install && pnpm run build
claude mcp add -s user tslsp node /absolute/path/to/tslsp-mcp/dist/index.js
```

## make claude actually use it

claude won't reach for an MCP tool just because it exists. you have to tell it, and you have to be explicit about which built-in tool it replaces. `tslsp install --skills` drops a ready-made SKILL.md that does exactly that. if you'd rather paste it yourself, here's the block — works in `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` or a project's `CLAUDE.md`:

## TypeScript code intelligence (tslsp)

In any TS/JS project with a `tsconfig.json`, the `tslsp` tools are type-aware
and MUST be used instead of the built-in text tools for the operations below.
Text tools see strings; tslsp sees the program.

Names below are the MCP shape (`tslsp:foo`). With the CLI, replace `tslsp:foo`
with `tslsp foo` — same arguments, same output.

| Task                            | DO use                   | DO NOT use                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Find every usage of a symbol    | `tslsp:references`       | `Grep`, `Glob`                          |
| Search for a symbol by name     | `tslsp:find_symbol`      | `Grep`                                  |
| Jump to a definition            | `tslsp:definition`       | `Grep` + `Read`                         |
| Jump to a value's *type*        | `tslsp:type_definition`  | `Grep` + `Read`                         |
| Find concrete implementations   | `tslsp:implementation`   | `Grep`                                  |
| Rename a symbol                 | `tslsp:rename`           | `Edit`, `MultiEdit`, find-and-replace   |
| Rename/move a file or folder    | `tslsp:rename_file`      | `mv` / `git mv` (won't update imports)  |
| Type / JSDoc for a symbol       | `tslsp:hover`            | `Read`                                  |
| Outline a file before reading   | `tslsp:outline`          | `Read` on the whole file                |
| Type errors after an edit       | `tslsp:diagnostics`      | `Bash` running `tsc` ad-hoc             |
| Trace callers / callees         | `tslsp:call_hierarchy`   | repeated `references` calls             |
| Organize imports / quick-fix    | `tslsp:code_action`      | manual edit                             |

Hard rules:

1. NEVER rename a TypeScript identifier with `Edit` or `MultiEdit`. Use
   `tslsp:rename`. Pass `dry_run: true` first when the symbol has many call
   sites; review the preview, then apply. This applies to every identifier —
   slice keys (`features.fooUi`), property names, enum members, the lot. If
   you find yourself string-editing a symbol "just for a couple of files"
   you have already failed the rule. For bulk renames (e.g. renaming a whole
   feature), enumerate symbols via `tslsp:outline` on each file in the folder
   first, then call `tslsp:rename` once per symbol — cheaper in tokens than
   grep+Read+Edit and safer (no false positives in comments / strings /
   unrelated identifiers).
2. NEVER `mv` or `git mv` a TypeScript file or folder. Use `tslsp:rename_file`
   — it walks every import that references the file and rewrites them. After
   the move you can still use `tslsp:rename` for any identifier inside.
3. NEVER `Grep` for a symbol name to find usages or definitions. Use
   `tslsp:references` or `tslsp:definition`. Grep matches strings in
   comments, in unrelated identifiers, in `.md` files — it lies.
4. Before reading a large file, call `tslsp:outline` first and use the line
   numbers to `Read` only the slices you need.
5. After non-trivial edits to a TS file, call `tslsp:diagnostics` on it to
   confirm it still type-checks before claiming the change is done.

Locator ergonomics: every position-taking tool accepts `{ symbol: "name" }`
(workspace search), `{ file, line, symbol }` (line scan), or full
`{ file, line, character }`. Use the cheapest form you have. Ambiguous
name-only queries return the candidate list; pick by file or line and re-call.

Batch: most read-only tools accept `symbols: ["a","b","c"]` (or `files: [...]`).
tslsp fans the requests out in parallel and labels each block with
`=== name ===`. One call beats N round-trips.

Fall back to the built-in text tools only for: string literals, comments,
non-TS files (Markdown, YAML, configs), or projects without a `tsconfig.json`.

## tools

| tool              | what it does                                                                                          |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `find_symbol`     | workspace symbol search by name. returns `path:line  kind name`.                                      |
| `references`      | every reference to a symbol. takes a locator or a `symbols: [...]` batch.                             |
| `definition`      | jump to where a symbol is defined. batches via `symbols`.                                             |
| `type_definition` | jump to a value's *type* declaration (vs. its value declaration). batches via `symbols`.              |
| `implementation`  | concrete implementations of an interface/abstract member. batches via `symbols`.                      |
| `rename`          | type-aware rename across every file. `dry_run: true` previews without writing.                        |
| `rename_file`     | move a file or folder; updates every import that referenced it. folders walked recursively.           |
| `hover`           | type signature + JSDoc for a symbol. batches via `symbols`.                                           |
| `outline`         | indented declaration outline. `files: [...]` batches.                                                 |
| `diagnostics`     | type errors. `file`, `files: [...]`, or omit (aggregate across every open file).                      |
| `call_hierarchy`  | callers and callees of a function. `direction: incoming` / `outgoing` / `both`.                       |
| `code_action`     | list quick-fixes / refactors / organize-imports; pass `apply: N` to apply by index.                   |

### symbol locator

every position-taking tool takes one of three shapes, in priority order:

```js
{ file, line, character }   // explicit LSP position
{ file, line, symbol }      // server scans the line for the identifier
{ symbol }                  // workspace symbol search; errors with candidates if ambiguous
```

LLMs know line numbers and symbol names but not character columns. modes 2 and 3 cover the gap.

### batching

most read-only tools take an array variant. fanned out in parallel, results labeled:

```js
tslsp:hover         { symbols: ["User", "Repository", "AuthService"] }
tslsp:outline       { files: ["src/api.ts", "src/db.ts"] }
tslsp:diagnostics   { files: ["src/a.ts", "src/b.ts"] }
```

```bash
tslsp hover       --symbols User,Repository,AuthService
tslsp outline     src/api.ts src/db.ts
tslsp diagnostics --files src/a.ts,src/b.ts
```

one tool call, N parallel LSP queries, one return.

## CLI

```bash
tslsp find-symbol User                          # positional == --query
tslsp references --symbol User
tslsp definition --symbol User
tslsp rename --symbol oldName --new-name newName --dry-run
tslsp rename-file src/old.ts src/new.ts --dry-run
tslsp rename-file src/components src/widgets   # folders supported
tslsp hover --symbol User
tslsp outline src/api.ts
tslsp diagnostics --file src/x.ts
tslsp call-hierarchy --symbol handleRequest --direction incoming
tslsp code-action --file src/x.ts --kind source.organizeImports
tslsp code-action --file src/x.ts --kind source.organizeImports --apply 0

tslsp --help                  # all commands
tslsp <command> --help        # per-command flags
tslsp install --skills        # drop SKILL.md into ~/.claude/skills/tslsp/
tslsp mcp                     # start the MCP server over stdio
```

## how it works

```
claude → stdio → tslsp-mcp → tsgo (project A)
                           → tsgo (project B)
                           → ...
```

on first tool call against a file, it walks up to the nearest `tsconfig.json`, spawns tsgo there, opens a seed file so the workspace symbol index populates, and caches the process. subsequent calls reuse it. when you edit files via `rename` or `rename_file`, it pushes `didClose`/`didOpen` + `workspace/didChangeWatchedFiles` (and `didRenameFiles` for moves) so the index reprojects.

## gotchas

- pins `@typescript/native-preview` to a specific dev build. tsgo moves fast and dev builds shift. bump the version in `package.json` deliberately.
- if you have an older homebrew-installed `tsgo` on your PATH, the MCP ignores it and uses the npm-pinned one. earlier versions had behavior we explicitly don't want.
- `rename` and `rename_file` write to disk. `dry_run: true` previews first; `git diff` is your friend either way.
- one tsgo process per `tsconfig.json` root. monorepos with many tsconfigs spawn many tsgos lazily; first hit per project pays project-load cost (~50ms on small, more on large).
- the CLI spawns a fresh tsgo per invocation. fine for one-off calls; for a tight refactor loop, the MCP server (warm process) is faster.
- set `TSLSP_VERBOSE=1` (or `TSLSP_MCP_VERBOSE=1`) to forward tsgo's stderr.
